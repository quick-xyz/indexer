# Task 3: Processing Pipeline Review & Database Migration

## Overview
This task focuses on reviewing the processing pipeline functionality, resolving end-to-end processing issues, and executing a clean database migration with all current tables and enhancements.

**Scope**: Full pipeline review, database migration, and end-to-end testing
**Goal**: Get a working single-block test with the new pricing architecture

## Prerequisites
- âœ… Direct pricing implementation complete (Task 2)
- âœ… Database architecture finalized with all tables designed
- âœ… CLI interface complete for pricing management
- âœ… Repository layer enhanced with bulk operations

## Critical Issues to Address

### **ðŸš¨ HIGH PRIORITY: Processing Pipeline Failures**

**Known Issues from Previous Work:**
- **End-to-end single test block failures** - processing not completing successfully
- **Enum case sensitivity problems** - capital vs lowercase inconsistencies causing errors
- **Processing logic bugs** - preventing successful block-to-database flow
- **Integration gaps** - potential issues with new database architecture

**Specific Problem Areas:**
1. **Domain Event Processing**: Signal generation, transformation, content ID creation
2. **Enum Consistency**: TradeDirection, PricingMethod, TransactionStatus across codebase
3. **Database Writers**: Integration with new detail tables and dual database pattern
4. **Error Handling**: Processing failures, retry logic, graceful degradation

## Phase 1: Pre-Migration Review

### **Task 1: Processing Pipeline Functionality Review**

**Components to Audit:**
- **IndexingPipeline**: Block processing flow and coordination
- **Transform System**: Signal-based transformers and event generation
- **Domain Event Writers**: Database insertion logic
- **Processing State Management**: Transaction and block processing tracking

**Focus Areas:**
```python
# Check these specific areas for issues:
1. Signal â†’ Domain Event conversion
2. Content ID generation consistency
3. Database session management
4. Error handling and retry logic
5. Enum value consistency (case sensitivity)
```

**Validation Steps:**
1. **Static Analysis**: Review enum definitions and usage patterns
2. **Flow Tracing**: Follow a single transaction through the entire pipeline
3. **Error Point Identification**: Find where processing typically fails
4. **Integration Testing**: Verify new pricing tables don't break existing flow

### **Task 2: Enum Consistency Audit**

**Known Problem Enums:**
- `TradeDirection`: "buy"/"sell" vs "BUY"/"SELL"
- `TradeType`: "trade"/"arbitrage" vs "TRADE"/"ARBITRAGE"  
- `LiquidityAction`: "add"/"remove" vs "ADD"/"REMOVE"
- `TransactionStatus`: Processing state consistency
- `PricingMethod`: New enum, ensure consistency

**Audit Process:**
1. **Catalog all enum definitions** across database tables and Python code
2. **Check enum usage** in transformers, repositories, and services
3. **Identify inconsistencies** between database constraints and Python values
4. **Create fix plan** for standardizing case sensitivity

### **Task 3: Database Schema Validation**

**Complete Schema Review:**
- **Shared Database Tables**: All configuration and pricing infrastructure
- **Indexer Database Tables**: All events, processing, and detail tables
- **Relationships**: Foreign keys, constraints, indexes
- **Enum Definitions**: Database-level enum consistency

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] All table definitions have proper constraints
- [ ] Enum values match between Python and PostgreSQL
- [ ] Foreign key relationships are correctly defined
- [ ] Indexes support expected query patterns
- [ ] Composite unique keys prevent data corruption

### **Task 4: Migration Approach Review**

**Current Migration Issues:**
- Previous migrations have been problematic
- Complex dual database setup
- New table additions since last working migration

**Migration Strategy Options:**
1. **Full Database Recreation**: Delete everything, create fresh
2. **Dual Database Coordination**: Ensure shared + indexer databases sync properly
3. **Table Creation Order**: Handle dependencies correctly
4. **Data Seeding**: Initial configuration data loading

## Phase 2: Migration Execution

### **Task 5: Clean Database Migration**

**Migration Steps:**
1. **Delete existing databases** (both shared and indexer)
2. **Create initial migration** with ALL current tables
3. **Execute migration** and validate schema
4. **Seed configuration data** (models, contracts, tokens)
5. **Verify database state** before proceeding

**Migration Validation:**
- [ ] All tables created successfully
- [ ] All constraints and indexes in place
- [ ] Enum values properly defined
- [ ] Sample data can be inserted without errors
- [ ] Repository queries work correctly

### **Task 6: Configuration File Review**

**Post-Migration Configuration:**
- **Database connections**: Verify dual database setup
- **Model configuration**: Ensure model definitions are correct
- **Contract mappings**: Pool addresses and transformer assignments
- **Service dependencies**: DI container setup for new repositories

**Configuration Areas to Review:**
1. **Database URLs**: Both shared and indexer database connections
2. **Model Definition**: Contract addresses, transformers, source paths
3. **Repository Registration**: New detail repositories in DI container
4. **Service Configuration**: Pricing service with dual database access

## Phase 3: End-to-End Testing

### **Task 7: Single Block Processing Test**

**Test Objectives:**
1. **Complete pipeline flow**: RPC â†’ Decode â†’ Transform â†’ Storage
2. **Domain event generation**: Trades, swaps, transfers, positions
3. **Database persistence**: Events stored correctly in indexer database
4. **Processing state tracking**: Transaction and block status updates

**Test Process:**
```python
# Target test flow:
1. Select test block with known transactions
2. Process through full pipeline
3. Verify domain events created
4. Check database state consistency
5. Validate processing completion
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Block processes without errors
- [ ] All expected domain events are created
- [ ] Database contains correct event data
- [ ] Processing state shows completion
- [ ] No enum or consistency errors

### **Task 8: Pricing Integration Test**

**After Successful Block Processing:**
1. **Run pricing service** on processed events
2. **Verify detail table population** for configured pools
3. **Check dual database operation** (shared configs + indexer details)
4. **Validate pricing accuracy** for test swaps/trades

**Integration Validation:**
- [ ] Pricing service can access both databases
- [ ] Pool configurations are read correctly
- [ ] Block prices are available for calculations
- [ ] Detail records are created with correct values
- [ ] CLI commands work with real data

## Implementation Phases

### **Phase 1: Diagnostic & Planning (Day 1)**

2. **Enum consistency audit** - catalog and fix case sensitivity issues
3. **Migration planning** - finalize approach and dependencies
4. **Schema validation** - ensure all table definitions are correct

### **Phase 2: Clean Migration (Day 2)**
1. **Database deletion** - clean slate approach

## Risk Mitigation

### **High-Risk Areas:**
1. **Enum Inconsistencies**: Could break event processing at multiple points
2. **Migration Dependencies**: Table creation order and foreign key constraints

4. **Processing Logic Bugs**: Hidden issues in transform or storage logic

### **Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Incremental Testing**: Validate each component before moving to next
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Track every step of processing for debugging

- **Processing bug fixes** for identified pipeline issues
- **Migration scripts** for clean database setup
- **Configuration updates** for new database structure

### **Validation Artifacts:**
- **Successful single block processing** with complete event data
